Whilst the Fablab is Open-Access, there are some protocols in place to ensure things run smoothly and safely.

If you would like to use the Digital Fabrication Machines, you must make a reservation so we can make sure we allocate staff to assist you. Please see the [Machine Reservations](#machine-reservations) section for full details.

The Lab is free to use, but if you which to use [materials](../lab#misc) from our stock for your Fab Lab project, these must be paid for. It is ok to bring your own materials, but please check with us that your material is suitable and safe to use with our machines. If you can bring us a sample to test, even better!

We will never ask for money to use the Fablab, but we do ask that you respect our philosophy of Open-Knowledge sharing by helping others, documenting your work and sharing what you have learnt. Check out the [Documentation](#documentation) section for more details.

Fab Labs are places were experimentation is encouraged, but never at the expense of safety. You must ensure you are properly trained before using the machines or tools. If you are unsure, speak to the Studio Master or one of the Lab Assistants.

By entering the Fablab Premises and using the facilities, you agree to the terms of our [Disclaimer](#disclaimer).
