The MDX-20 is a precision desktop CNC milling machine which is usually reserved for finer detailed work, such as PCB milling, where very small amounts of material are removed. It runs well with the Fab Lab Network's own suit of software tools, Fab Modules, from a simple black and white .png image and can also be set up to run from Autodesk Fusion 360.
