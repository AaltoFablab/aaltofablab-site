We have fully equipped electronics workstations for assembly, testing and debugging. We also stock an inventory of surface-mount and through-mount components from the Fab Lab [Inventory](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/about/fab/inv.html){:target="_blank"}. There is usually a workstation available during our opening hours for drop-in use, but you can also reserve a workstation for bigger projects or extended sessions.
