The Asus Xtion is a handheld Optical / Infrared sensor that can be used in conjunction with Skanect Pro software to capture objects in 3D. 3D-Scanning is a bit of an art and takes some practice to get decent results. Best used for capturing complex geometry which cannot be modeled in software easily.
