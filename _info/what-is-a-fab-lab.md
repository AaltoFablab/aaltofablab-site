Aalto Fablab is part of a global network of [1000+ Fab Labs](http://www.fablabs.io/map){:target="_blank"}.

A Fab Lab is a technology prototyping platform where learning, experimentation, innovation and invention are encouraged through curiosity, creativity, hands-on making and crucially through open knowledge sharing.

Each Fab Lab has a common set of tools and processes, so you can learn how to work in a Fab Lab here in Helsinki for instance, and use those skill in any one of the 1000+ other labs across the globe.

To be a Fab Lab means connecting to a global community of learners, educators, technologists, researchers, makers and innovators who contribute to an open knowledge sharing network that spans 30 countries and 24 time zones.

You can read more about Fab Labs on the Fab Foundation website [here](http://fabfoundation.org/index.php/what-is-a-fab-lab/index.html){:target="_blank"}.
