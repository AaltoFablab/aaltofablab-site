The Roland monoFab SRM-20 is a precision desktop CNC milling machine which is usually reserved for finer detailed work, such as PCB milling, where very small amounts of material are removed. It runs well with the Fab Lab Network's own suit of software tools, [Mods](http://mods.cba.mit.edu/) (or Fab Modules which is the older version), from a simple black and white .png image. Use Roland V-Panel software to move the head around and calibrate it.
