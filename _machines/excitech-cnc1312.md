Our new large-format CNC Router can take a half-sheet of standard panel material (1220 mm x 1220 mm) and has an increased Z-axis capacity to enable even bigger 3D-carved projects (technically up to 400 mm). Incredible accuracy (Â± 0.05 mm) and finish quality can be achieve with the correct handling. Great for larger projects using heavier solid materials.
!This machine is loud and causes a lot of vibration in the floor. Therefore it's important to also book the self-recording studio (kd150) during the same time so that recording sessions are not interrupted.
