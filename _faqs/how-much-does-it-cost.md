Not a penny!...

The Fablab is free for all to use, but you must cover the cost of any materials you use from our stock. In return for using the Lab for free, we ask kindly that you document the work you do in the Fablab in the appropriate way. For small things, a simple share on social media is great (remember to tag **@AaltoFablab** and us the **#AaltoFablab** and **#MadeInFablab** hashtags). For more substantial projects, we recommend using fablabs.io to share your work with the global community. See the [documentation](#documentation) section for more details.

Sharing is caring!
