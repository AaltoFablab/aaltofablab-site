Aalto Students, Staff and Researchers can reserve machines via [takeout.aalto.fi/fablab](https://takeout.aalto.fi).
The Fablab machines are available to everyone on the Public Open Days every Thursday from 12:00 - 16:00, during which times the machines are available on a first-come, first served basis.

\*Although the machine you wish to use may be available according to the schedules, we have to make sure there are enough skills in the Lab to supervise all activities at any given time. For this reason, we may suggest an alternative time to make sure you get the level of attention needed...
