Digital Fabrication looks in more detail into the world of Fab Labs and maker-spaces, and how to develop ideas, prototype and iterate using Digital Fabrication Tools. 3D-Printing, Computer-Controlled Cutting, CNC Machining and Programmable Electronics using Arduino and Raspberry Pi will be covered, and you will develop your own project using what you have learnt.
