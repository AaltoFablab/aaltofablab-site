With it's fully enclosed build chamber and activated carbon air filter that absorbs bad smells that some materials can emit while printing, the ZYYX is marketed as a "fume free" printer. The ZYYX also has a fully automatic build plate calibration and leveling system, to ensure prints adhere to the platform well and are completed reliably.
