We hold a stock of commonly used sheet materials and 3D-printer consumables available for purchase and use in-house with our Digitial Fabrication machines. You may bring your own materials, but please check that they are safe to use and compatible with our machines with a member of staff.

Unfortunately, as our stock is limited, our materials are sold for use in the Fablab with our machines and not external workshops.
