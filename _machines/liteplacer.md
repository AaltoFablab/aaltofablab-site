The [LitePlacer](http://www.liteplacer.com/){:target="_blank"} is a pick and place machine used for automating the assembly of intricate surface-mount electronics components. Developed (and kindly donated to us!) by [Juha Kuusama](http://www.kuusama.com/){:target="_blank"} for use in his high-end HIFI and home theatre audio business, Kuusama Ausio Oy, the LitePlacer uses CNC-control and image recognition to accurately place components that are too tricky and time consuming to place repeatedly by hand.
