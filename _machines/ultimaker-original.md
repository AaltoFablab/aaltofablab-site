Originally developed at ProtoSpace Fablab Utrecht in the Netherlands, the Ultimaker Original has become something of an icon in the Maker world. The printer was inspired by the RepRap project, but development focused on print speed and quality over self-replication. Although released in 2011 (a bit of a grandpa by current standards) these printers are still great for many applications.
