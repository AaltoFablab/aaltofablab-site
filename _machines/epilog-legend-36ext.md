The workhorse of any Fab Lab is it's laser cutter! Cut, score and engrave onto sheet materials and flat surfaces using a precisely controlled CO2 laser. Requiring only 2D data to control the cutting path means the laser cutter has a very low barrier to entry, so you can very quickly go from idea to finished object.
