Aalto Fablab doesn't charge for machine use or an annual membership. Instead, we ask that you "pay forward" what you have learned from using the Lab to other users, who may be able to build upon your work and develop faster.

This is achieve through Documentation, and is common to all Fab Labs across the network.

At Aalto Fablab, we use the following documentation strategy:

1. Document your work at [fablabs.io](http://www.fablabs.io/projects){:target="_blank"}, using the tag <span class="bold">"AaltoFablab"</span>

2. Include an explanation and photos of your process, machine settings and original design files

3. Let us know when you're documentation is ready and well share it with the Aalto Fablab community through our social media channels. If we really like your project, we'll also get in touch to ask if we can do a detailed feature for the [Share](../share) section of our website
