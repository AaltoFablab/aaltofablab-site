Arduino is synonymous with programmable electronics, prototyping and open-source. Arduino provides an accessible platform to enable beginners to prototype electronic systems using pluggable components and basic coding, all wrapped in a friendly IDE. A great place to begin with electronics!

Our Arduino Boards, shields and components are available to use in the Lab and can be taken out on short-term loan where necessary.
