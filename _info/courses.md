We have 2 credit-giving [courses](../courses) which are regularly held at Aalto Fablab (<span class="bold">Digital Workshop Basics</span> and <span class="bold">Digital Fabrication Studio</span>), as well as Fab Academy and other special interest courses making use of the technology and openness of the Fablab.

If you have an idea for a course that you would like to run at the Fablab, please get in touch!
