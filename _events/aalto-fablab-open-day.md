It's been a while since our last public open day – About time we do something about it again!

Maybe you want to know what digital fabrication laboratory is or you have a great product idea and want to change the world. Or want to meet, share and develop your ideas with similar minded makers…

Every other Thursday from 12.00 to 17.00 at Aalto Fablab, with the generous assistance from our most dedicated community members we will explore the potential of a FabLab.

If you have questions you can get in touch with us: fablab\[@\]aalto.fi

You’re all invited!
