Aalto Fablab is an Open-Access Digital Fabrication Lab, which means the tools, tech and facilities are available for all to use.

In practice, this means that our doors are open to any member of the Aalto community (students, staff, researchers, etc.) during our normal [opening hours](#opening-times), and that we regularly hold public open days and events for absolutely anyone to attend.

Open-Acess is a key philosophy behind all Labs in the Global Fab Lab network.
