Fablab Open Days is now active every Thursday from 12:00 - 16:00. Normally the Fablab is reserved for Aalto University students and staff. During Open Days the doors are open for everyone and anyone that wants to come and make use of the Fablab for personal projects or professional experimentation. Reservations aren't possible except on site and service and the machines are available on a first-come-first-served basis.
