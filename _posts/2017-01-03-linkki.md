Linkki is a modular kinetic construction toy which uses planar linkage mechanisms to create movements and teach basic science, engineering and mathematics by hands-on playing.

The project was created by Eunyoung Park with many of the parts made in Aalto Fablab using CNC Machining, 3D-Printing and Electronics.
