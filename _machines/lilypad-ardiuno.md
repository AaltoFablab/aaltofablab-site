LilyPad is an Arduino-based wearable electronics system, with small discrete nodes that can be connected using conductive thread. They are even washable! Just as simple to use as the official Arduino boards, and great to use in wearable and e-textile applications.

Our LilyPad Boards and components are available to use in the Lab and can be taken out on short-term loan where necessary.
