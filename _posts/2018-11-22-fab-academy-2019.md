We're still not at 100% capacity but the reservation system is working and our fire alarms are too. Use Takeout.aalto.fi/fablab to book a machine and start fabricating.

Open Days everything Thursday from 12:00 - 18:00. Booking on this day on a first-come-first-served basis and the door are open to everyone. 

If you're new to the Fablab, it's a good idea to bring a sketch or something to help the staff understand what it is you are trying to do.



Still out of order: CNC machines, foam cutter and vacuum forming machine.
