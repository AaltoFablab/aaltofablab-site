Our workshop area is equipped with most common handtools, some basic powertools and consumables such as sandpaper and glue. As every maker knows, "a craftsman is only as good as his tools", which is why we like to keep our tools in good condition and organised so we can find them when we need them!

The tools are for use in the Fablab, we don't lend them out. Sorry!
