The Form 1 is a Stereolithography (SLA) 3D-printer that can produce high-resolution prints from photopolymer resin. The printer uses a laser to cure layer upon layer of photopolymer resin until the 3D form is complete. Use it for detailed parts that need higher resolution that FDM printers can produce. Check out it's big brother the [Form 2](../machines/formlabs-form-2).
